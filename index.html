     there will be 3 command exicute one by one in command line 
     refresh the page repostory  is uploaded
     
    
     go to command prompt and clone repostory using command : cd documents + enter 
     + git clone  + url of the repostory

     cd repostory + enter 
    ls

    if u create new file 
    git add . 
    git commit -m 'test' 
    git push 


    now go and check in github new file will be uploaded

<h1>branches</h1>
<h2>
    git branch -> u get current working branch "*main"
git branch  <name_of_the_new_branch>    //create a new branch
git branch test    //creating a new branch named test
git branch         //u get list of all branches *main,test
git checkout   <name_of_the_branch>       //to switch to that particular branch
git checkout test         //switching to test branch
git branch -> u get test branch as working branch "main,*test"
write some code in test branch ->  output will be visible but changes only done in test branch 
not on main branch 

git   add . 
git   commit -m "message for the commit"
 still out is visible only in test branch 


 git checkout main         //now switching back to main branch
 //output will not be visible here because we are in main branch 
//but our changes are still there in test branch
git merge test            //merging the test branch into main branch
//conflict may arise if both brnach have same code at same place
//then resolve conflict manually or use git mergetool
if  no conflict comes up then u will see -> Merge made by recursive.
now main branch  has all the content of test branch

<!-- git branch -d <name_of_the_branch>        //delete the given branch -->
